# fw

fw.c - a program which takes in text files as
inputs (through stdio.h) and prints out the
most used words and their frequency to STDOUT.

By default, the program will print out the 10
most common words and their frequency. If the
user would like to view more or fewer results,
the command line flag "-n" can be used.

Usage: fw [-n num] [file1 [file2 ...] ]
